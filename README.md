# ACL Relay Synchronization

This repository hosts the ***ACL Relay Synchronization*** project, designed to provide a robust, scalable, and efficient mechanism for synchronizing Access Control Lists (ACLs) across a network by using a custom relay system. The project leverages relay-based communication protocols to ensure data consistency and real-time updates in environments with multiple nodes.

---

## Features

- **Real-time Synchronization**: Ensure that ACL updates are propagated to all nodes with minimal latency.  
- **Distributed Architecture**: Built to handle distributed systems with multiple endpoints.  
- **High Scalability**: Optimized for large-scale systems with numerous ACL rules and nodes.  
- **Resilient Communication**: Uses a relay-based protocol for reliable message delivery.  
- **Extensible Design**: Easily integrate with other systems or extend functionality as needed.  

---

## Prerequisites

Before setting up or contributing to the project, ensure you have the following installed:  

- **Go**: Version 1.20 or later for compile FFI go library.
- **rust**: For build relay-synchronization application.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.  
- Any necessary dependencies will be specified in the `go.mod` file.  

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hetu-project/acl-relay-synchronization.git
   cd acl-relay-synchronization
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

3. **Configuration**:
   Adjust the configuration file ( `config.yaml`) to set up relay endpoints and ACL rules.

---

## Usage

This project acts as a middleware to synchronize ACLs between multiple nodes.  

- **Add ACL Rules**: Use the provided API to add or update rules dynamically.  
- **Monitor Updates**: Nodes receive real-time updates when ACLs are modified.  
- **Extend Functionality**: The relay design allows you to plug in custom logic or integrate with external systems.
